# X4: Foundations - Scavenger

This mod adds a new trade order to the ship order menu. Scavengers wait in a given sector for drops, does not matter if it is a ware or item. They collect everything, and if the cargo space is less than 10%, they try to find a buyer withion a 5 sector range. If necessary, they split the order and sell at more than 1 station. They always try to find the best price, that is known to the player. Define in the order configuration, if illegal wares are allowed or not. 

You can configure a limit of inventory items, default is 250. After they collected more, they automatically fly to the HQ (if the player has one) and drop all items there. Then they return to their sector.
